# Fourth Milestone Project / PEWN
____
The live site: (https://eshop-project4.herokuapp.com/)

Pewn is an ecommerce site built using Django, to showcase my skills in a Full Stack website. The purpose of the website is to allow a user 
to access the sites to purchase video games. If the user wishes to buy the video games they  will have to register with the site and make an
account. Once the user has made an account the site will automatically generate a very basic profile for the user. Here they can change the details
of their profile such as there email adress and profile picture. A default profile picture is supplied if the user does not wish to change this themselves.

In addition to purchasing games, users may use the website to leave their own reviews on a game. These reviews can be found in the details page of each game.
This is also where the form to leave reviews can be found. Each review requires a rating and the average of the total ratings is displayed for each game.
A user may only leave one review per game.

When the users access's the site they will land on the home page. The home page is designed to allow for the owner to post information about the site and
provide some basic information about how to use the site as well as any upcoming news or sales events. These posts are provided in carousel format, and may
only be provided by the site administrator through the backend administration page.


## UX Design:

### Strategy

#### Who is this for?
This website serves as a fictional ecommerce shop for anyone who wishes to sell products online such as video games, in this case.

#### What type of content will be relevant? 
The content on the site will be made up of a collection of some of my favourite games. Each game has a details page where you can view more information about 
each game such as genre, release date, multiplayer options etc.

Media content â€“ The games are displayed in a tile format in a library. Each tile has a title image for the game. Each tile itself is a clickable link to a page 
                for more information about that game. To avoid gathering large amounts of media for the site, each game model only requires two images, a large
                background title image for the games detail page and a a small title image for the game tiles. To substitute for the lack of imagery each game-details
                page has a trailer which is displayed in a video modal. Each of the trailers is taken from Youtube.


### Scope

#### What does the client need?
* A brand name to help make the site more recognisable and create a sense of familiarity.
* A mobile first website approach
* A "Home"/ landing page which contains some information about the site itself.
* A "Store" page displaying all of the games, including an image, name and price for each game tile.
* A "Game details" page providing more information about each game.
* A review form, to allow users to post their own review for each game.
* A registration page for a user to create an account.
* A login page to allow the user to login
* A basic profile page for each user, with a profile image, username and email address.
* A "cart" page to allow users to view the items they are interested in.
* A "checkout" page to confirm purchase order and handle payment.

#### User scenarios
**Scenario:**
A user would like to view the site ---  
**Requirement:**
The ability to click on a link and be directed to the home page.

**Scenario**
A user wishes to learn more information about the site. ---
**Requirement:**
Obvious information on the Home page explaining what the site is and how to use it. Information about the site and any relevant news 
should be available as a post on the website provided by the site administrator through Djano's built in admin page.

**Scenario:**
A user wants to view what games are for sale ---  
**Requirement:**
A "Store" link should be available in the navbar to access the sites collection of products. This page will access all of the products models
from the site database. Pagination will be used to spread out the collection of products on to more than one page to allow for easier naviagtion.

**Scenario:**
A user wants to check if a specififc product is sold by the site ---  
**Requirement:**  
A search bar should be contained in the navbar to allow a user search if that specific product is available on the site. This will require a search
filter to filter out databse results using the users query.

**Scenario:**
A user wants to view more information about a product available in the store  ---  
**Requirement:**  
Each product tile should serve as a link allowing the user to easily and intuitvely access that prodcuts detals and information. In the HTML each tile
div will be wrapped in an an anchor link. 

**Scenario:**
An anonymous user/ registered user would like to browse the sites products and add items to a cart ---  
**Requirement:**  
The site will need a "Cart" page which will allow the user to edit their choices before commiting to a purchase. To achieve this a cart context will
need to be created so that the cart's contents are available anywhere on the site. Cart views will also need to be created which allow
the user to add and remove items from the cart.

**Scenario:**
A user would like to purchase a product ---  
**Requirement:**  
In order to purchase a product an anonymouse user will need to register to the site and make an account. Once they have done this, a checkout page and
some form of payment processing api will then be require to allow the user to purchase the items. The checout page will require two forms. One form will
be used to create an order item in the site's database. The second form will be used to handle the user's payment information.

**Scenario:**
A user would like make an account on the site ---  
**Requirement:**  
The site will require a registration page. Here they will register a username, email address and confirm a password choice. This will
require the use of Django's built in authorization and authentication models to create users in the database.

**Scenario:**
A user would like login to their account  ---  
**Requirement:**  
The site will require a login page. Here they will login with their login credentials created at registration. This will require a login view and a login form.

**Scenario:**
A user would like to edit their account information  ---  
**Requirement:**  
A basic profile will be created automaically by the site when the user makes an account. Here the use will be able to change the information they registered
with, as well as the default profile picture.

**Scenario:**
A user would like to leave a review on a product ---  
**Requirement:**  
On each game details page there will be a form to leave a review. In order to leave a review the user will need to be logged in. If they are not logged in,
they will be redirected to the login page, or, if they do not have an account, the registration page. Once the user logins they will be redirected to the
review form. To make this do this a review model and review form will be created. The form will allow the user to intreract with a star rating. This will
require the use of some Javascript and jQuery.


### Structure

#### Information Architecture
For this project I will be using a standard tree structure. To achieve this, the header of each page will 
consist of a navigation bar that contains the logo of the business and the main navigational links for each page in the website. 


## Features

### Existing Features
* Feature 1 - A "store" page that displays all of the games in the database in the form of tiles. Each tile displays a title image for the game,
                the game title, a price and an add to cart button. 

* Feature 2 - A registration page containing a form that allows the user to create an account.

* Feature 3 - A login page containing a form that allows the user to log in to their account.

* Feature 4 - A "Game details" page that shows more information about each game.

* Feature 5 - Each "Game details" page contains a video modal that plays a trailer for each game. 

* Feature 6 - An "Add review" button. This will toggle the display value for the review form. If the user is not authenticated then a message will redirect 
                them to a login or registration page. This avoids needlessly writing a review that cannot be submitted if the user is not logged in.

* Feature 7 - An "Cart" page that allows the user to view all of the items in their cart and add or remove items. 

* Feature 8 - A "Checkout" page that allows the user to review their order. The forms here create an order object in the database and the second Stripe form handles 
                payment.

## Testing

### Manual Testing 
In order to ensure the website functioned as expected, most of the testing for this project was done using the browser web developer tools. This was a very 
important tool for me through the creative process as it helped me to isolate where the problems were in my code. The issues that this helped me resolve 
include:

* Navigation bar and page links:
1. Click each link and check to that each page is rendered.

* Media settings:
1. Create a super user via the CLI.
2. Log in to the super user account through the login form.
3. Head to the "profile" page and check to see the default image is displaying.

* Registration form - empty/partially filled form:
1. Fill out the form leaving the first field empty.
2. Try to submit a partially filled form and check for the required field messages.
3. Repeat for each field.

* Registration form - password confirm:
1. Fill out the form.
2. Deliberatley mismatch passwords.
3. Submit form and check for error message.

* Registration form - login message and redirect:
1. Fill out the fom create a new "TestUser".
2. Submit the form.
3. Check to see that the user is redirected to the login page and the "succesful account creation" message is displayed.

* Registration form - user model:
1. Log in to the admin page with the super user credentials.
2. Check to see that a new "TestUser" was created.

* Registration form - existing user:
1. Fill out the form using the same username "TestUser".
2. Try to submit the form and check for "user already exists" error message.

* Login form:
1. Login with the "TestUser" credentials.
2. Check to see redirectd to "Home" page and "successful login" message.

* Login form - error messages:
1. Login with a non-existing user.
2. Check for error message.
3. Login "TestUser" with wrong password.
4. Check for error message.

* Logout:
1. Click the logout button in the navbar.
2. Check to see redirectd to "Logout" page and "Logout succesful" message.

* Update profile form:
1. Change username to "TestUser2", email and the default picture.
2. Submit form and check for success message and updated details.
3. Check user info updated in admin site.

* Update profile form - existing username:
1. Register a new "TestUser".
1. Change username of "TestUser2" to "TestUser".
2. Submit form and check for "Username already exists" message.

* "All games" view:
1. Create some game models with and without sale discounts in the admin site of the project.
2. Go to the "Store" page and check to see that the game models have been loaded and their images are displaying.

* Cart: 
1. Add multiple items to cart.
2. As items are added check "product count" variable displayed in the navbar increases by 1 with each request.
3. Once an item has been added three times check "Max limit" error message is displayed.
4. Add games to the cart with and withoput sale prices to test the "total" variable.
5. On the "Cart" page, remove items from the cart and submit.
6. Check "quantity" value has changed in the forms quantiity input.
7. Remove a game completely from the cart.
8. Check that the game is removed.
9. Remove all games from the cart and check for the "Empty shopping cart" message.

<!-- * Delete Recipe Feature:
1. Login and navigate to "My recipes".
2. Click a recipe to view and navigate to the "view recipe" page.
3. Click the delete button and check to see that the user is redirected to the "recipes" page and the recipe has been deleted.

I used a *code validator* on [W3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to checks for any errors that needed to be 
fixed in my code. 

Finally, I posted my project in the peer-code-review channel on Slack and received some very helpful criticism to help me fix some mistakes that 
slipped under the rader.

## Features Left to implement
The only feature in the project I could not get working was the search bar functionality. The search bar does not yield
any results at the moment. 

## Deployment 
1. The project was written and developed in the Gitpod IDE.
2. A local repository was intialized using Git. Regular changes were commited to the local repository.
3. Github was used as a remote repository, and at the end of each development session, all local commits were pushed to (https://github.com/martycistudent/milestone-project3)
4. The projectâ€™s source file was published from GitHub repository to GitHub pages using GitHub default settings via the master branch.
5. The project was linked to Heroku for deployment, a requirements.txt file and a Procfile were created to deploy the project on Heroku.
6. Configuration variables had to be set in order to get the project running. These had to be set in both the Gitpod IDE and on Heroku.
These included, PORT, IP, Mongo URI and a SECRET KEY.
5. The Projectâ€™s source file is now published as a site on Heroku at [Grubhub](https://database-milestone-project.herokuapp.com/)

## Credits
### Media 
The full width background image on the index page of the website was taken from a stock image website called [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/search/food+background) 

### Acknowledgements 
#### Front End Design
For the main layout of this project I took inspiration from [Jamie Oliver's cooking website](https://www.jamieoliver.com/) and [BBC goodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/).
This is also where I found most of the recipes to populate the website. 

#### Back End
To complete this project I relied on additional reasearch in order to get the reistration and login features of the page fully 
functional.

To help me understand the logic required for the registration and login features of my site I watched this video:
* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVx1737auSE)
In order to create a form that could check whether or not the passwords enterd matched certain criteria I found these pages
that helped me figure out how to access the values being entered, as well as the appropriate event handlers I needed to use.

* (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_password_validation.asp)
To use message flashing I had to read the documentation for the Flask website to help me unserstand how Flask messagin worked.
* (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#sessions)
To get the search bar functioning I relied on the code provided to me by my mentor who helped me to undertsand how it worked
